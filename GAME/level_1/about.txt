Hi, folks! 

Here is a mini quest in ctf-like style. Follow task.txt and
fill the gaps. By filling the gaps you will answer the questions
and learn basic linux commands like:
- cd
- rm
- ls
- pwd
- reboot
- grep
- passwd
- whoami
- cat
- su
- apt
- ps
and so on. U will be guided throught several FHS directories like:
- /var/tmp
- /root
- /var/logs
- /opt
Also u will learn how to reset root password, how to install some
programms and how to find out a process pid.


This is a first version of the task! I'm trying myself in writing
tasks in such way, so be patient for my mistakes.

kind regards,
Bykva.
